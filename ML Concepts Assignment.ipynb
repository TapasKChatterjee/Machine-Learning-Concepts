    "ML is a subset of AI that involves algorithms and statistical models allowing machines to improve their performance on a task over time without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "Example: Consider an email spam filter. Instead of explicitly programming rules for what constitutes spam, a machine learning model can be trained on labeled data (emails labeled as spam or not spam). The model learns patterns from this data and can predict whether new, unseen emails are spam or not based on what it has learned.\n",
    "#### c) Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "DL is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep architectures) to automatically learn representations from data.\n",
    "Example: Image recognition tasks are a classic example of deep learning. For instance, a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of labeled images can recognize and classify objects in new images. It learns various features and patterns at different levels of abstraction, enabling accurate identification of objects.\n",
    "In essence, AI encompasses the broader concept of machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms learning from data.
